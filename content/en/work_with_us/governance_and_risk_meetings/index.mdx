# Governance and Risk Meetings

## Weekly governance meetings provide a chance to participate in the community and help shape the future of Maker.

In these meetings, we set the stage for cultural and operational consensus across the community for a number of issues that relate to the [Scientific Governance and Risk Framework](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance-risk-framework/part-one).

## Weekly Meeting

Weekly meetings happen **every Thursday** at 4pm UTC (9am PST). We’d love to have you!
