# Hackathons

## Hackathons encourage diverse groups to hack on prototypes for new products and services

They're a great way to meet new and talented people, learn new skills, get access to the latest and greatest tools, and get noticed by communities like MakerDAO. 

We use these events to find and fund great developers who can help us continue building better money.

If you’re organising a hackathon and want to request funding, you can [apply for a grant](/funding/hackathon-funding.md) paid in Dai.

## First Hackathon?

We’ve prepared a guide to help you understand what to expect. It covers what you should bring and some best practices
for navigating these events and integrating what you learn afterwards.

## Development Grants

Our development grants program uses hackathons to find good candidates to fast-track. If you’re looking for a grant, taking part in a hackathon
is a good way to get our attention.
