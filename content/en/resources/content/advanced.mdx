# Advanced

We finished our intermediate tutorial with the `<Box>` - a basic element that behaves like an html
`<div>` and allows us to have many new lines, a.k.a. **children**, behave like one child when rendered as
a React component. Now it's time to see the advantage of this pattern when creating more complicated, visual
components which you could not dream of in normal md.

## Returning to images

When we first showed you how to use images in the basic tutorial, we did not add any props. Thus, there was a
slight visual issue with the bottom margin, and the image is always left-aligned. Now it's time to fix that.
Images on the web are a whole rabbit hole, and Gatsby uses a specific plugin - `gatsby-remark-images` - to process
and load things extra quickly. Unfortunately, this means it wraps our images and we don't really want to hack around
in that to get center-alignment or any of the other good things our designers desire. So, we have a wrapper component of
our own called `<Aligner>`.

The reason we're only introducing it now is because using it requires understanding a few things about DAI-ui - the
theme library we're using - and how it can be used to style React components. Without getting too technical, there is
something called [emotion css](https://theme-ui.com/sx-prop), which allows us to style our components inline by adding another prop called `sx`. Just
like `mdx` extends `md`, `sx` extends the possible `styles`. The variety of ways in which you can use `sx` is almost endless,
so check out our cheatsheet for some basic starting points, and then dive into the beauty that is DAI-ui.

```md:title=aligned-image.mdx
<Aligner center sx={{marginBottom: 4}}>

<Image src="../../../images/starfox.png"/>

</Aligner>
```

Will give us both a centred image, as well as a better margin beneath it:

<Aligner center sx={{marginBottom: 4}}>

<Image src="../../../images/starfox.png" />

</Aligner>

We use the prop `center` here, though there are others available to you, listed in the cheatsheet.

You could have specified `sx={{marginBottom: "10px"}}`, but the `4` here indicates a preset from DAI-ui -
which you can also find in the gatsby-plugin-theme-ui index file - which helps
ensure that all our margins and padding through the site remain the same, without having to change each individual
component. So, if you are going to add you own styles, the best practice is to ensure you use the correct preset.
You can find a list of presents and their associated values on the cheat sheet page too.

Here is the critical point: **You can add whatever style you like to your components**. You actually
have **complete control as a content creator** over how your content appears, without ever needing a nerdy developer
to come and insert stuff for you. Congratulations, you are now a junior front-end developer!

## Arranging Content Visually

Sometimes we'll want to split out content up into visual chunks to make it easier for 
readers to process and understand at a glance. Enter Columns, Chocolate Boxes, Categories, Touts, and InfoBlocks. 

### Column

The column is a great example of where it is almost always necessary to wrap your children in boxes. Our specs
called for a "2 Column Comparison component" but we developers must implement every edge case including when there's only 1 element.

This component follows the same principle as other advanced components in that each child is it's own column element.

```md:title=columns.mdx
<Column>

Child A - Full Width

</Column>

<Column>

Child A - with Sibling

Child B - with Sibling

</Column>

<Column>

<Box>

#### Child A

Full Width with a Header

</Box>

</Column>


<Column>

<Box>

#### Child A

With a sibling and a Header

</Box>

<Box>

#### Child B

With a sibling and a Header

</Box>

</Column>
```

---

<Column>

Child A - Full Width

</Column>

---

<Column>

Child A - with Sibling

Child B - with Sibling

</Column>

---

<Column>

<Box>

#### Child A

Full Width with a Header

</Box>

</Column>

---

<Column>

<Box>

#### Child A

With a sibling and a Header

</Box>

<Box>

#### Child B

With a sibling and a Header

</Box>

</Column>

### Chocolate Box

The Chocolate component is a 3 column component. It's the equivalent of using a Grid,
except that it's opinionated on its sizing and gaps. The "Box" part of chocolate boxes comes from the combined use of the Box component
to render content in each grid cell.

The child rule here works the same. Each child is 1 grid cell (Box) in the Chocolate component.
We recommend that you use the Box component for more detailed content.

```md:title=chocolate-icons.mdx

<Icon name="eye"/>

### Touts

Touts are really just a step up on CTAs, which can be arranged to look good on a page, 
similar to the chocolate boxes and categories introduced above.

## InfoBlocks

Info Blocks inline all the content you pass into them and have 2 states:

1. Image on the Left

```md:title=left-image-infoblock.mdx
<InfoBlock>

<Image src="../../../images/starfox.png"/>

The best place to start is in our chat. Say hello and get to know us.

<Link icon="rocketchat">Community chat</Link>

</InfoBlock>
```

<InfoBlock>

<Image src="../../../images/starfox.png" />

The best place to start is in our chat. Say hello and get to know us.

<Link icon="rocketchat">Community chat</Link>

</InfoBlock>

2. Image on the Right

```md:title=right-image-infoblock.mdx
<InfoBlock>

# Say hi!

<Link icon="rocketchat" to="https://chat.makerdao.com">Community chat</Link>

![Starfox](../../../images/starfox.png)

</InfoBlock>
```

<InfoBlock>

# Say hi!

<Link icon="rocketchat" to="https://chat.makerdao.com">
  Community chat
</Link>

![InfoBloStarfoxck](../../../images/starfox.png)

</InfoBlock>

> If you put the image first (whether as a React component or as a normal
> md image), it will appear on the left, and if you put it anywhere else, it will appear on the right.

Categories was deprecated to chocolate only. 8-5-2020
### Categories

The Categories component is nearly the same as the Chocolate component, except that it
has a different visual design (it's width is 107.58% and not 100% of the content's parent container).
It also has a different rendering style depending on whether there are 2 or 4 elements.
The stark difference for you is that you only control the content of the Category container,
not the entire box itself (i.e. you can't change the background of a category box, only it's contents).

The component is also capable of having a unique status bar placement. All that's needed is that
your categories child has the status banner first:

```md:title=categories.mdx
<Categories>

<Box>

<StatusBanner warning> Funding is currently closed </StatusBanner>
 
<Icon name="metamask"/>
