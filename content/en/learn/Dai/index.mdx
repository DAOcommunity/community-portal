# Dai

The Dai stablecoin is a decentralized, unbiased, collateral-backed cryptocurrency soft-pegged to the US Dollar. Dai is held in cryptocurrency wallets or within platforms, and is supported on Ethereum and other popular blockchains.

Dai is easy to generate, access, and use. Users generate Dai by depositing collateral assets into Maker Vaults within the Maker Protocol. This is how Dai is entered into circulation and how users gain access to liquidity. Others obtain Dai by buying it from brokers or exchanges, or simply by receiving it as a means of payment.

Once generated, bought, or received, Dai can be used in the same manner as any other cryptocurrency: it can be sent to others, used as payments for goods and services, and even held as savings through a feature of the Maker Protocol called the Dai Savings Rate (DSR).

Every Dai in circulation is directly backed by excess collateral, meaning that the value of the collateral is higher than the value of the Dai debt, and all Dai transactions are publicly viewable on the Ethereum blockchain.

Dai is collateral-backed money whose value is pegged to the US Dollar.

The Dai token lives on the Ethereum blockchain. All circulating Dai are generated from [Maker Vaults](vault.mdx) and are backed by a surplus of collateral assets.

## Why Dai?

A decentralized digital economy needs stable money in order to function. Dai is a price-stable asset that can be used as a medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account.

Dai enables a wide range of financial activities and applications that have previously been untenable due to the volatility of legacy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

### Applications

In addition to the [Dai Savings Rate](dsr.md), which enables Dai users to earn accruals on the Dai they save, here is a non-exhaustive list of things Dai can be used for:

#### Exchange pairs:

Crypto-to-crypto trading can be a complicated proposition. It is difficult to track earnings when both sides of a trading pair are rising and falling in value. Creating markets that pair with DAI creates lower risk markets for market makers, and gives regular traders a stable asset to trade against.

#### Merchants:

Merchant receipts, cross-border transactions, and remittances: Dai transactions are borderless and settle in minutes compared to legacy cross-border transaction solutions, which often take days or weeks and charge high fees.

#### Prediction markets and gambling:

 Long term betting becomes infeasible if users also have to gamble on the future price of the asset they are wagering. A cryptocurrency with price stability like Dai can be the natural choice for prediction markets or gambling applications.

#### Retail:


Retail and Consumer Use of Cryptocurrency: Use of cryptocurrency in regular day-to-day economic activity can only scale with a stable asset as a medium of exchange. Dai fills this role perfectly.
