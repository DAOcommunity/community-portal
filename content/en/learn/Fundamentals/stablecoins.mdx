# Stablecoins

Blockchain technology promises to revolutionize the way the world does finance by bringing banking to the unbanked and returning financial independence to individuals.

For the world to reap the benefits and fully realize the advantages of blockchain technology, there must be global adoption.

## Barriers to Adoption

Any application that requires a low threshold of volatility to be viable on a blockchain, consumer loans, for example, cannot be denominated in a currency that fluctuates 10–20% in a day, like Bitcoin or Ethereum. When using Bitcoin to send a remittance from one country to another, there's a good chance that its price movement during one block confirmation (how long it takes the blockchain to include a transaction) will be higher than any fees charged by Western Union or PayPal. Operating a business with thin margins, for example, becomes near impossible when the underlying currency is so volatile. If betting on the outcome of a presidential election six months in advance, it doesn't make sense to denominate that bet in Ether.

## Stability

Stablecoins are what will allow us to realize the promise of blockchain technology fully.

The concept of a stablecoin is relatively straight forward — it’s a token (like Bitcoin or Ether) that exists on a blockchain. However, unlike Bitcoin or Ether, it has no volatility.

**“How can something have no volatility? Volatility is relative!”**

To maintain stability, a stablecoin would be pegged to an external, stable asset, like the US Dollar. The goal is to maintain a value relative to that asset. There are many approaches to solve this problem, some are better than others, and each has its trade-offs.

## Stablecoins

Some stablecoins projects hold USD in bank accounts and issue tokens on-chain that are ‘backed’ by these dollars. These are essentially IOU tokens or legally-backed cryptocurrency. If those bank accounts should ever be frozen or if the accountants defrauded token holders, the stablecoin now becomes an IOU on whatever’s left when they eventually get the bank accounts back (if they ever regain the bank accounts). This system relies on the legal system to maintain cryptocurrency tokens and inserts an unreliable middle-man into the blockchain.

Most importantly, stablecoins make cryptocurrency trading more accessible to the average person. They allow decentralized exchanges (exchanges without a trusted intermediary, where users always maintain full custody of their funds) to denominate trading pairs in U.S. dollars instead of Bitcoin or Ether.

## We Can Do Better

### Enter Dai

Dai is Maker's stablecoin. It lives fully on the blockchain chain with its stability unmediated by the legal system or any counterparties.

The asset that Dai is trying to be stable relative to is the U.S. Dollar. So, to summarize, one Dai equals one dollar. Dai is the first working consumer-grade stablecoin.
