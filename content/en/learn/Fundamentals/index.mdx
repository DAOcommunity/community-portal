# First Principles

As Andreas Antonopoulos famously said:

**"Your keys, your Bitcoin. Not your keys, not your Bitcoin."**

The advent of cryptocurrencies returned financial control to the individual, but with that freedom came new responsibilities. Following best practices to effectively and securely store assets is arguably the most important way for users to protect their wealth.

Delving into the trustless world of cryptocurrency may require abandoning reliance on third-parties. A bank can freeze a checking account, but no one can freeze a truly non-custodial wallet. Still, there are trade-offs. Banks help their clients recover access to an account, even if they lose their password. On the other hand, trying to recover a wallet without the seed phrase and passcode, often leaves users with no recourse.

The individual is given the freedom to be fully responsible for their assets if they so choose. As the industry matured, there are now options that cater to users across various comfort levels. Each has its trade-offs.
