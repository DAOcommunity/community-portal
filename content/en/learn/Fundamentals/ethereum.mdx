# Ethereum 101

**THIS IS PLACEHOLDER PLAGIARIZED CONTENT ðŸ‘‡**

Ethereum is a technology that lets you send cryptocurrency to anyone for a small fee. It also powers applications that everyone can use and no one can take down.

It's the world's programmable blockchain.

Ethereum builds on Bitcoin's innovation, with some big differences.

Both let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable, so you can also use it for lots of different digital assets â€“ even Bitcoin!

This also means Ethereum is for more than payments. It's a marketplace of financial services, games and apps that can't steal your data or censor you.
