##### Decentralized Exchanges & DEX Aggregators

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">
</span>A great way to obtain Dai is with a Decentralized Exchange (DEX). By design, DEXs are non-custodial, not bound by geographic restrictions, and don't involve trusting third-parties. They can trade straight from their Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) while retaining full control of their assets.

DEXs offer numerous benefits, but there are trade-offs.

**_Trade-Offs:
_**

* **_Privacy: Trades happen on-chain and, therefore, are pseudo-public. In some regards, a public link between transactions and addresses reduces privacy. However, it may help third-party software keep track of trades for tax and documentation purposes._**
* **_Slippage: For large orders there is a risk of receiving a different trade execution price than expected, this is called slippage. To reduce this risk, a DEX Aggregator can be used to split up a large order across multiple DEXs._**

1. **[Oasis](https://oasis.app/)
**- Flagship platform by MakerDAO.

- Limit and market orders.
- Access to core Maker features.

1. **[Kyber](https://kyberswap.com/)**  

- Simple UI, similar to Uniswap.
- Minimal fee (0.3%)
- Ideal for small to medium sized orders.
- Watch for slippage.

2. **[Uniswap](https://uniswap.exchange/)
**- Simple UI**
**- Minimal fee (0.3%)

- Ideal for small to medium sized orders.
- Watch for slippage.

3. **[1inch Exchange](https://1inch.exchange/#/)**

- DEX aggregator
  - Splits orders among multiple DEXes and attempts to get the best price.
- Works like other DEXs.
- Choose which DEXs to spread orders across using toggle switches.

##### Peer-to-Peer Marketplaces

Peer-to-peer markets fill the gaps in regions that lack access to suitable exchanges or have restrictions on cryptocurrency trading. These marketplaces act as fiat on-and-off-ramps, enabling users to later trade on DEXs that offer more liquidity and fairer pricing.

1. **[LocalCryptos](https://localcryptos.com/)
**A peer-to-peer marketplace, to buy and sell Ethereum over various payment rails. It uses escrow to handle transactions.
2. **[LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/)**
A peer-to-peer marketplace to buy and sell BTC. Convert BTC to ETH or any other currency on an exchange, like [Binance](http://www.binance.com).
3. **[Bisq](https://bisq.network/)**
An open-source, peer-to-peer application for buying and selling cryptocurrencies in exchange for national currencies. No registration required

**Popular Ways to Earn**

1. **Oasis Save**

## Borrow

DeFi lending skips the red tape and cuts out the middlemen. Borrowing Dai is easy, but borrow responsibly.

There are two ways to "borrow" Dai within DeFi. Generate Dai on Oasis or use a lending platform.

**_Note: _**Be mindful of risk. Borrowing incurs fees, and most platforms require securing loans with collateral. Visit [DeFi Score](https://defiscore.io/) for help gauging a platform's risk.

#### Platform Risk
