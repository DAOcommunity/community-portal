# What is a DAO?

DAO stands for ''Decentralized Autonomous Organization.'' In the context of MakerDAO, a decentralized governance community manages the Maker Protocol through an embedded governance mechanism.

The organization is made up of all MKR token holders, vocal community members, and ecosystem stakeholders. MKR holders have the sole authority to enact changes to the system through on-chain voting.

It is decentralized because no single party has full control over the system and autonomous in that once deployed, the Maker Protocol facilitates governance through the built-in governance mechanism and the existence of MKR.
