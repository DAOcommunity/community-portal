# What is a DAO?

A decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, is a kind of organizational structure that prioritizes decentralization for governance. DAOs rely on their stakeholders to maintain and advance the project. In the context of MakerDAO, its community manages the Maker Protocol through an embedded governance mechanism.

MakerDAO is composed of MKR token holders, vocal community members, and ecosystem stakeholders. MKR holders have the sole authority to enact changes to the system through on-chain voting.

Since it is decentralized, no single party has full control over the system. Once deployed, the Maker Protocol facilitates governance through the built-in governance mechanism and the existence of MKR.
