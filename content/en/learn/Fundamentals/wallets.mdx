# Storage

Keep your cryptocurrency safe! Itâ€™s money, so treat it as such! Make sure to store it properly and securely.

## Wallets

**_Note:_** Since Dai is an Ethereum based asset, this section focuses on storage solutions specific to Ethereum.

### What is a Wallet?

A wallet is like a bank account, except for holding cryptocurrency. Some wallets support solely Ethereum-based tokens, while others can store tokens from multiple blockchains.

Learn more about how Ethereum wallets work at [Ethereum Wallets](https://ethereum.org/wallets/) and [Silent Cicero](https://silentcicero.gitbooks.io/pro-tips-for-ethereum-wallet-management/ethereum-wallet-basics/what-is-an-ethereum-wallet.html) for in-depth discussions on wallets and security.

#### Seed Phrases, Private Keys, and Passcodes

Wallets are generated from a random seed phrase, and a secure passcode protects entry. The seed can regenerate the wallet and restore access to the funds if the passcode is lost or forgotten. As such, keeping both the seed and the passcode private is critical.\*\* **Keep both the seed and the passcode safe and private.**

Follow advice offered at [MyCrypto](https://support.mycrypto.com/staying-safe/protecting-yourself-and-your-funds) and [Coinbase](https://blog.coinbase.com/the-keys-to-keeping-your-crypto-safe-96d497cce6cf) for some best practices.

**_Pro Tip: _**Make several copies of the recovery seed, and store them in different geographical locations, in case one location gets compromised by something like a flood or fire.

### Wallet Types

Over the years, storing cryptocurrency has gotten easier. Today, users can choose from various wallet options to fit their specific needs.

1. Custodial Wallets (Not Your Keys)

- Custodial services and exchanges store funds and private keys on their private servers.
- Pros: These companies take over the burden of proper security and can restore account access if a user loses a password.
- Cons: They can freeze accounts, lose funds to a hack, misplace funds during maintenance, or otherwise restrict access.
- Example: [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/dashboard)
