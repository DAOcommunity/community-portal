MakerDAO is the decentralized governance community that enables the generation of [Dai,](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/dai) the world’s leading decentralized stablecoin.
 
The community manages the generation of Dai through an embedded governance mechanism called the Maker Protocol.

The Maker Protocol, the set of smart contracts that make Dai possible, is run by the decentralized governance community of MakerDAO. The Maker Protocol, as one of the largest decentralized applications (DAPPs) on the Ethereum blockchain, was the first decentralized finance (DeFi) application to earn significant adoption.

All Dai is backed by a surplus of collateral that has been locked into audited and publicly viewable Ethereum smart contracts. Anyone with an internet connection can monitor the health of the system anytime at [daistats.com](https://daistats.com/) or [through other third-party tools.](https://awesome.makerdao.com/#watch-dai)


The organization is made up of all MKR token holders, community members, and ecosystem stakeholders. MKR holders have the sole authority to enact changes to the system through on-chain voting.

### Why did the founders call it "MakerDAO?"

The idea of MakerDAO became public on March 26th, 2015 with Rune Christensen’s post, [Introducing eDollar, the ultimate stablecoin built on Ethereum](reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/30f98i/introducing_edollar_the_ultimate_stablecoin_built/), on the r/ethereum subreddit.

"Maker" comes from from the term Market Maker. 

This was driven in part based upon [BitUSD's](https://web.archive.org/web/20200426202839/https://bitshares.org/technology/price-stable-cryptocurrencies/) inability to attract market makers, which resulted in its lack of robust liquidity. 

One of the original ideas was to distribute MKR to cryptocurrency market makers, which we later started calling keepers, to ensure they were incentivized in the system and would help bootstrap its liquidity.

The Maker Community is the wide world of people and organizations that use or support Dai. In short, the Maker Community is MakerDAO. From early adopters to Maker Foundation Employees to MKR holders, the Maker Community is an indispensable and critical part of the Maker system.
