# What is a DAO?

### Learn about Decentralized Autonomous Organizations 

MakerDAO is a decentralized governance community that manages the Maker Protocol through an embedded governance mechanism.

It is **decentralized** in that no single party has full control over the system and **autonomous** in that once deployed, the Maker Protocol facilitates governance through the built-in governance mechanism and the existence of MKR.

The organization is made up of all MKR token holders, community members, and ecosystem stakeholders. MKR holders have the sole authority to enact changes to the system through on-chain voting.
