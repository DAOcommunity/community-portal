# Development Grants

## Funding

We fund all kinds of teams creating infrastructure and applications within the Maker ecosystem. 

So far, we've awarded 683,887 Dai since February 2018.

### What We Fund

- Tools that directly benefit Dai and MKR users 
- Tools that increase Dai adoption 
- Tools that increase access to personal liquidity

### What We Don't Fund

Due to the high volume of worthy requests we receive and the limited resources available, we prioritize applications with conservative budgets.

- Pure R&D 
- Information gathering 
- Additional runway 
- Generic Ethereum ecosystem improvements 
- Large marketing budgets
- Dai giveaways and airdrops

## Requirements

This grant is for teams building on Maker or Dai. You'll need to:

- [ ] Self-direct your own work 
- [ ] Actively commit to regular check-ins 
- [ ] Work fast and openly
- [ ] Share code repository activity 
- [ ] Communicate often – with us and other members of the cohort 
- [ ] Split your work into milestones – we distribute blocks of funds as you reach predetermined milestones.

Our [Grantee Playbook](/grantee-playbook/) should give you more an idea of what's expected.
