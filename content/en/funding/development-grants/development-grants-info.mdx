# Development Grants

The MakerDAO Community grants program funds projects that increase Dai adoption, support emerging economies, open new markets, provide novel uses for the stablecoin, or other further the MakerDAO Foundation's principles.

We allocate grants ranging from 5K - 50K Dai. We distribute blocks of funds as teams reach their predetermined milestones.

## Requirements

The model we use to incubate our grants requires regular check-ins, operational transparency, high developer velocity, active repositories, and frequent communications with MakerDAO and other members of the cohort. 

How well teams meet these requirements will determine whether they reach their milestones and whether additional funds will be released.

This grant is for any teams building on Maker or Dai.

<Checklist>

Self-direct your work.

Actively commit to regular check-ins.

Work fast and openly.

Share code repository activity.

Communicate with other members of the cohort and us often.

Split your work into milestones. We distribute blocks of funds as teams reach predetermined milestones.

</Checklist>

Our [Grantee Playbook](/grantee-playbook/) will provide an idea of what's expected.

Due to the high volume of worthy requests we receive, and the limited resources available, we prioritize applications with conservative budgets.
