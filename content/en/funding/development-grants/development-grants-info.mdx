# Development Grants

The MakerDAO Community grants program is designed to directly support projects that increase Dai adoption, support emerging economies, open up new markets, provide novel uses for the stablecoin, or otherwise further the principles of the MakerDAO Foundation.

We allocate grants in the range of 5K - 50K Dai. We distribute blocks of funds as teams reach predetermined milestones.

## Requirements

You’ll need to be a highly self-directed remote team and as such, the model we use to incubate our grants require regular check-ins, operational transparency, high developer velocity, active repositories, frequent communications with MakerDAO and other members of the cohort. How well teams meet these requirements will determine if a milestone has been reached and whether additional funds will be released.

This grant is for teams building on Maker or Dai. You'll need to:

<Checklist>

Self-direct your own work 

Actively commit to regular check-ins 

Work fast and openly

Share code repository activity 

Communicate often – with us and other members of the cohort 

Split your work into milestones – we distribute blocks of funds as you reach predetermined milestones.

</Checklist>

Our [Grantee Playbook](/grantee-playbook/) should give you more an idea of what's expected.

Due to the high volume of worthy requests we receive and the limited resources available, we prioritize applications with conservative budgets.
