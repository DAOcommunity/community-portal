# Community Projects

Got an idea for improving the MakerDAO community? Community Development can provide up to 5,000 Dai to help make it happen. In order to fund projects we have a useful program called  CDIPs.

The Community Development Initiative Proposal (CDIP) is the scoping and framing tool for anyone interested in receiving funding for proposing new MakerDAO community initiatives or resources.
