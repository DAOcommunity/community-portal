# Hackathon Sponsorship

If you’re planning a hackathon that will leverage the features of
Dai and MakerDAO, you could be eligible for funding.

## Eligible Hackathons

<Checklist>

Very conservative sponsorship requirements \(under 5,000 Dai\)

Located in, or targeted at, Asia-Pacific \(APAC\), Latin America \(LATAM\), Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa \(SEEMEA\)

Direct connection to talent and hackathon attendees \(via chat, forum, Github, etc.\)

Themes focused on governance, risk management, stability and derivatives, and/or privacy tooling.

Current hackathon challenge themes can be found under the "Hackathons" label in the [Community-Development Github ↗](https://github.com/makerdao/community/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahackathons)

</Checklist>

If your hackathon meets all the above criteria, please fill in this short application form.
We'll review your application and let you know what the next steps are.

We’ve prepared a guide to help first-time hackers understand what to expect.
You might want to share this with everyone taking part in your hackathon.
