If the volatility of the price of gold is 10% per day, you would probably want something around $125.

We have assumed that $125 of gold would be sufficient to cover the $100 loan. What about a $1m loan? Well we know the amount of collateral we would need is $1.25m, but getting rid of $1.25m in gold is a more complicated problem than getting rid of $125 of gold. We have to consider the liquidity of the market yet again. `}</p>\n      <p>{`What is required is an adjustment of the collateral value to compensate for liquidity risk.

Then the final collateral value required would be $1.435m.`}</p>\n      <p>{`Given the volatility risk, and a uniform application of the liquidity risk adjustment, we have determined that to borrow $100 one would need to pledge $143.50 in collateral.`}</p>\n      <p>{`The outstanding issue is the duration of the loan. If the loan is for longer than a day, then more collateral needs to be posted or an adjustment to the collateral needs to be performed on a daily basis. `}</p>\n      <p>{`Considering the loans in MakerDAO are open-ended, we don't need a massive amount of collateral. Unlike a traditional loan, loans of Dai are immediately liquidated if a default occurs. `}</p>\n      <p>{`The applicable period to consider is then the length of time to liquidate the position. So we will include a predetermined maximum amount of time to liquidate the position and adjust the collateral calculation for it.`}</p>\n      <p>{`To summarize, from volatility risk we can calculate the initial amount of required capital, from liquidity risk we can make a liquidity adjustment to the calculation.
