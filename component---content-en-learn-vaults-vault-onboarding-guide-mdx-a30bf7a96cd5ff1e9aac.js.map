<h1>{`Vault Onboarding Guide`}</h1>\n    <p>{`The Maker Protocol offers access to decentralized, non-custodial, and permissionless leverage through Maker Vaults. Users can generate the Dai stablecoin by locking assets as collateral in a Vault using Oasis Borrow. It is important for individuals to be mindful of the risks associated with Vault usage, including those indicated in the applicable Terms of Service. This brief guide outlines the basics of getting started with Vaults on Oasis Borrow. While it presents the main features of Oasis Borrow, it only serves as an overall and general introduction.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"/images/vault-onboarding-1.png\",\n        \"alt\": \"Maker Vaults on Oasis.App - Introduction to Oasis Borrow\"\n      }}></img></p>\n    <h2>{`The Basics`}</h2>\n    <h3>{`What is a Vault?`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The Maker Vault is a core component of the Maker Protocol, which facilitates the generation of Dai against locked up collateral. All Dai in circulation are created by Vaults.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Vault usage collectively alters the total supply of Dai. Users create Dai by generating it against their collateral and in-turn destroy Dai when repaying their generated Dai balance. This process happens on-chain, which enables full auditability of circulating Dai and the collateral backing it.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Vaults are not free to use and come with inherent risks. Generating Dai requires the payment of `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/learn/vaults/stability-fees/\"\n      }}>{`Stability Fees`}</a>{` (SF). The SF is a variable rate and is subject to change based on the decisions of MKR Token holders through `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/learn/governance/how-voting-works/\"\n      }}>{`voting`}</a>{`.

There are no repayment schedules, no minimum payments, and no credit history requirements. Users can repay at their own pace as long as their Vault is properly collateralized.
