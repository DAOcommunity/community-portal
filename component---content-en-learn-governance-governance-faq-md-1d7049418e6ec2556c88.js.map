The first is that a vote creates a barrier for new proposals, since new proposals need to surpass the voting weight of the last successful proposal. Secondly, votes are meant to remain in the system continuously in order to prevent bad proposals from passing easily. Finally, the more votes there are on the current state of the system, the more secure the system generally is from any \"rogue\" proposals.`}</p>\n    <p>{`MKR token holders are tasked with maintaining the health of the system and the stability of the peg while defending against any proposals that seem antithetical to the prudent governance of the system. If a proposal is introduced that MKR holders recognize as beneficial, then the majority of tokens may shift to this new proposal and implement it as the new state of the system.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In this model, the continuity of staked votes challenges and reinforces the status quo of the system through movements of the majority of votes between the most recent successful proposal and new proposals. To revert a change in the system an entirely new proposal must be put forth. It is impossible to reactivate an old proposal.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Why is the Continuous Approval Voting System necessary?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The Executive Vote represents the current state of the system. As the state of the system is continuously active, it requires continuous governance. At any time a competing proposal to the system could be introduced. If MKR token holders do not agree with the new proposal, then they should cast their votes for the current state of the system (or leave MKR there if they were already voting for the current state), implying that they do not want to see anything changed.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The continuity of the system is emphasized in the fact that a new proposal can be submitted at any time. Therefore, the system needs to be continuously monitored and governed, and thus requires a voting construct that reflects this need. The Continuous Approval Voting model solves this problem.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`How Long is the Voting Period of an Executive Vote?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Executive Votes do not conclude within a set period, which is part of the design of Continuous Approval Voting. For instance, if a vote does not garner enough votes at first, it may do so later if the proposal gains in popularity.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Nonetheless, governance may propose Executive Votes that terminate after a certain amount of time.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Can anyone start an Executive Vote?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Yes, anyone can create an on-chain Executive Vote using the MakerDAO governance contracts. However, there is no non-technical UI available to do this.

The linked wallet setup allows users to vote using a hot wallet, with MKR stored on a cold wallet.\nSetting up a Voting Contract is a one-time action as long as the same wallet or wallets are used in future voting.

The linked setup does not allow the MKR to be transferred to any address apart from the cold wallet.

This is useful for secondary governance mechanisms, allowing users to continue to vote on governance polls and executive votes without unlocking their MKR.
