Organizations running Feeds, however, are different. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Organizations are much more resilient against coercion, have the resources to combat malicious actors, and have their reputations at stake.

A reputation system's vulnerability to a Sybil attack depends on how cheaply identities can be generated, the degree to which the reputation system accepts inputs from entities that do not have a chain of trust linking them to a trusted entity, and whether the reputation system treats all entities identically.\" - `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack\"\n      }}>{`Wikipedia`}</a></p>\n    <p>{`The short answer is yes, the Oracle system is resistant to Sybil attacks because of the existence of a whitelist for Feeds. It's not simple to become a Feed, they need to be approved by MKR governance. Therefore, an attacker cannot gain a majority influence by creating many pseudo-feeds.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`What happens if there is a flash crash on an exchange?`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Since the reference price published by the Oracles is a median of the median prices that are reported by at least 20 different Feeds, outliers are automatically filtered out. `}</p>\n    <p>{`In practice, this means if a single exchange experiences a flash crash the set of prices will look something like this:`}</p>\n    <p>{`[0.70, 104.80, 104.82, `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`104.88`}</strong>{`, 104.90, 105.02, 105.04]`}</p>\n    <p>{`The median of this set still reflects the real market price of the asset.
