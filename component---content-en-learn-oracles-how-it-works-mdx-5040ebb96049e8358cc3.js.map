Organizations running Feeds, however, are different. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Organizations are much more resilient against coercion, have the resources to combat malicious actors, and have their reputations at stake. This makes them much better equipped to be Feeds with public identities. A hybrid model is optimal, one that incorporates the benefits of both individual and organizational Feeds.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Is the oracle system Sybil-resistant?`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Yes, the oracle system is resistant to Sybil attacks. The system uses a whitelist for feeds and becoming a feed requires approval by MKR governance. Therefore, an attacker cannot gain a majority influence by creating many pseudo-feeds.`}</p>\n    <p>{`\"In a Sybil attack, the attacker subverts the reputation system of a peer-to-peer network by creating a large number of pseudonymous identities, using them to gain a disproportionately large influence. A reputation system's vulnerability to a Sybil attack depends on how cheaply identities can be generated, the degree to which the reputation system accepts inputs from entities that do not have a chain of trust linking them to a trusted entity, and whether the reputation system treats all entities identically.\" - `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack\"\n      }}>{`Wikipedia`}</a></p>\n    <h3>{`What happens if an exchange experiences a flash crash?`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The reference price published by the Oracles is a median of the median prices reported by at least 20 different Feeds, outliers are automatically filtered out. `}</p>\n    <p>{`In practice, this means if a single exchange experiences a flash crash the set of prices will look something like this:`}</p>\n    <p>{`[0.70, 104.80, 104.82, `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`104.88`}</strong>{`, 104.90, 105.02, 105.04]`}</p>\n    <p>{`The median of this set still reflects the real market price of the asset.
